smriprep: A Robust Preprocessing Pipeline for Structural MRI Data
=================================================================

This pipeline is developed by the `Poldrack lab at Stanford University
<https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/>`_ for use at the `Center for Reproducible
Neuroscience (CRN) <http://reproducibility.stanford.edu/>`_, as well as for
open-source software distribution.

This package is called directly from fMRIPrep_.

The workflow is based on `Nipype <https://nipype.readthedocs.io>`_ and encompases a large
set of tools from well-known neuroimaging packages, including
`FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/>`_,
`ANTs <https://stnava.github.io/ANTs/>`_,
FreeSurfer_,
and `AFNI <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/>`_.
This pipeline was designed to provide the best software implementation for each state of
preprocessing, and will be updated as newer and better neuroimaging software becomes
available.

Support is provided on `neurostars.org <https://neurostars.org/tags/smriprep>`_.
